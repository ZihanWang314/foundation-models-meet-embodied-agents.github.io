We will cover the advances of the foundation models into Large Language Models Vision-Language Models, and Vision-Language-Action Models. In this tutorial, we will comprehensively review existing paradigms for foundations for embodied agents, and focus on their different formulations based on the fundamental mathematical framework of robot learning, Markov Decision Process (MDP), and present a structured view to investigate the robot’s decision-making process.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"141f39e3fab4746476b311b14eb59d6b","permalink":"https://foundation-models-meet-embodied-agents.github.io./aaai25/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/aaai25/about/","section":"aaai25","summary":"An embodied agent is a generalist agent that can take natural language instructions from humans and perform a wide range of tasks in diverse environments.
